        <h3>Financial Data Consolidation System</h3>
        <div class="tools-used">Technologies: SQL, Python, Apache Spark</div>
        <div class="dataset-title" style="font-size:0.8em; color: var(--color-text-secondary);">Date: February 2025</div>
    </div>
    <p class="project-objective"><strong>Objective:</strong> To design and implement a scalable, centralized financial data warehouse for a multi-entity hospitality group, enabling comprehensive, real-time reporting and advanced analytics.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Architected and deployed a Spark-based data lake, consolidating financial data from 7 disparate business entities, managing over [mention data volume, e.g., 10TB of data or millions of transactions].</li>
        <li>Developed and automated robust ETL pipelines using Python and PySpark for daily data ingestion, transformation, and validation, ensuring [mention data quality metric, e.g., 99.9% data accuracy].</li>
        <li><strong>Key Result:</strong> The new system reduced the monthly financial close time by 40% (from [X days to Y days]) and empowered management with interactive dashboards for strategic decision-making, leading to [mention a business outcome, e.g., a Y% improvement in resource allocation efficiency].</li>

    <span class="project-number">Project II</span>
     <div class="project-header-text">
        <h3>Corporate Expense Analysis & Optimization</h3>
        <div class="tools-used">Technologies: R, Shiny, MongoDB</div>
        <div class="dataset-title" style="font-size:0.8em; color: var(--color-text-secondary);">Date: December 2024</div>
    </div>
    <p class="project-objective"><strong>Objective:</strong> To develop an analytical platform for comprehensive corporate expense pattern analysis across divisions, identifying significant cost-saving opportunities and enhancing budgetary control.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Processed and analyzed over 50,000 expense transactions stored in MongoDB using R, overcoming challenges related to [mention a challenge, e.g., unstructured data or varying schemas].</li>
        <li>Developed an interactive R Shiny dashboard allowing management to dynamically explore expense trends and identify anomalies, resulting in [mention user adoption/feedback, e.g., adoption by X departments].</li>
        <li><strong>Key Result:</strong> Identified potential annualized savings of approximately 12% (equivalent to [Dollar Amount]) of total operational expenses. My data-driven recommendations for policy changes led to an actualized saving of [Dollar Amount/Percentage] in the first year.</li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Customer Segmentation & Revenue Growth</h3>
        <div class="tools-used">Technologies: Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas), Tableau</div>
        <div class="dataset-title" style="font-size:0.8em; color: var(--color-text-secondary);">Date: October 2024</div>
    </div>
    <p class="project-objective"><strong>Objective:</strong> To leverage machine learning for customer segmentation and analyze revenue patterns to develop targeted marketing strategies and predict future customer lifetime value (CLV).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Analyzed 3 years of customer transaction data ([mention data scale, e.g., millions of records and hundreds of features]) using Python and Pandas for data wrangling and feature engineering.</li>
        <li>Implemented K-Means clustering (Scikit-learn) to identify 5 distinct customer segments with unique demographic profiles and spending behaviors, validated using [mention validation metric, e.g., silhouette scores].</li>
        <li><strong>Key Result:</strong> Created actionable Tableau dashboards visualizing segment characteristics. Targeted marketing campaigns based on these segments resulted in a [e.g., Y% increase in conversion rates] and a [e.g., Z% growth in revenue from targeted segments].</li>
    </ul>
