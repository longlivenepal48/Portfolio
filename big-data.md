    </div>
    <p class="project-objective"><strong>Objective:</strong> To design and implement a scalable, centralized financial data warehouse for a multi-entity hospitality group, enabling comprehensive, real-time reporting and advanced analytics.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Architected and deployed a Spark-based data lake, consolidating financial data from 7 disparate business entities, managing over [mention data volume, e.g., 10TB of data].</li>
        <li>Developed and automated robust ETL pipelines using Python and PySpark for daily data ingestion, transformation, and validation, ensuring [mention data quality metric].</li>
        <li><strong>Key Result:</strong> The new system reduced the monthly financial close time by 40% and empowered management with interactive dashboards, leading to [mention a business outcome].</li>
    </ul>
