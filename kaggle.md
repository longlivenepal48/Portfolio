          <h3>Financial Statement Fraud Detection</h3>
          <div class="dataset-title">Competition: Fraud Detection in Financial Reporting (Top 15%)</div>
          <div class="tools-used">Date: March 2025</div>
      </div>
      <p class="project-objective"><strong>Objective:</strong> To develop a robust machine learning model to identify potential fraudulent patterns in corporate financial statements, aiming for high precision and recall.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Engineered over [Number] novel features from financial ratios and transactional patterns.</li>
          <li>Employed an ensemble of Random Forests and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) that effectively captured complex fraud indicators, overcoming challenges like [mention a challenge, e.g., highly imbalanced dataset].</li>
          <li><strong>Key Learning/Result:</strong> Achieved an AUC score of [e.g., 0.91] on the private leaderboard. My feature engineering approach focusing on [mention specific aspect] was a key contributor.</li>

        <h3>Hotel Booking Demand Forecasting</h3>
        <div class="dataset-title">Competition: Tourism Industry Predictive Analytics (Top 25%)</div>
        <div class="tools-used">Date: January 2025</div>
    </div>
    <p class="project-objective"><strong>Objective:</strong> To accurately predict hotel booking demand by leveraging historical data and external factors, enabling better resource allocation and dynamic pricing strategies.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed a time series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet/SARIMA) integrating seasonal trends, holidays, weather, and local event schedules. My approach involved [mention a specific technique].</li>
        <li>Performed extensive feature engineering to capture lead time dynamics and customer segment behaviors.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Learning/Result:</strong> Successfully identified [mention a key driver] as a significant predictor. My model achieved a [mention metric, e.g., MAE of X bookings]. ([Optional Link to Kaggle Notebook Here if not linking whole card]).</li>

        <div class="dataset-title">Source: Public Economic Datasets (Self-driven Project)</div>
        <div class="tools-used">Date: November 2024</div>
    </div>
    <p class="project-objective"><strong>Objective:</strong> To conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Nepal's economic trends (2015-2024), with a focus on the tourism and hospitality sectors.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collected, cleaned, and integrated data from multiple public sources (e.g., [mention sources]).</li>
        <li>Performed comprehensive EDA, identifying key trends in GDP, inflation, tourism arrivals using [mention tools].</li>
        <li><strong>Key Contribution:</strong> Published a public report/kernel ([Link if available]) summarizing findings and providing an accessible overview of Nepal's recent economic trajectory.</li>
