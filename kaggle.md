          <h3>Financial Statement Fraud Detection</h3>
          <div class="dataset-title">Competition: Fraud Detection in Financial Reporting (Top 15% out of [Number] participants)</div>
          <div class="tools-used">Date: March 2025</div>
      </div>
      <p class="project-objective"><strong>Objective:</strong> To develop a robust machine learning model to identify potential fraudulent patterns in corporate financial statements, aiming for high precision and recall.</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Engineered over [Number] novel features from financial ratios, textual data (e.g., from MD&A sections using NLP techniques if applicable), and transactional patterns.</li>
          <li>Experimented with various algorithms, ultimately employing an ensemble of Random Forests and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) that effectively captured complex fraud indicators, overcoming challenges like [mention a challenge, e.g., highly imbalanced dataset].</li>
          <li><strong>Key Learning/Result:</strong> Achieved an AUC score of [e.g., 0.91] on the private leaderboard, demonstrating strong predictive power. My feature engineering approach focusing on [mention specific aspect] was a key contributor.</li>

        <h3>Hotel Booking Demand Forecasting</h3>
        <div class="dataset-title">Competition: Tourism Industry Predictive Analytics (Top 25% out of [Number] participants)</div>
        <div class="tools-used">Date: January 2025</div>
    </div>
    <p class="project-objective"><strong>Objective:</strong> To accurately predict hotel booking demand by leveraging historical data and external factors, enabling better resource allocation and dynamic pricing strategies.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed a time series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet/SARIMA with exogenous variables) integrating seasonal trends, holiday effects, weather data, and local event schedules. My approach involved [mention a specific technique, e.g., careful handling of multiple seasonality].</li>
        <li>Performed extensive feature engineering to capture lead time dynamics, length of stay preferences, and customer segment behaviors.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Learning/Result:</strong> Successfully identified [mention a key driver] as a significant predictor of booking cancellations. My model achieved a [mention metric, e.g., MAE of X bookings] on the test set.</li>

        <div class="tools-used">Date: November 2024</div>
    </div>
    <p class="project-objective"><strong>Objective:</strong> To conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Nepal's economic trends (2015-2024), with a focus on the tourism and hospitality sectors, to uncover growth patterns and correlations.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collected, cleaned, and integrated data from multiple public sources (e.g., [mention sources like World Bank, Nepal Rastra Bank, Dept. of Tourism]).</li>
        <li>Performed comprehensive EDA, identifying key trends in GDP, inflation, tourism arrivals, and sector-specific employment using [mention tools, e.g., Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) and Tableau Public].</li>
        <li><strong>Key Contribution:</strong> Published a public report/kernel ([Link if available, e.g., on Kaggle or a blog post]) summarizing the findings and providing an accessible overview of Nepal's recent economic trajectory.</li>
