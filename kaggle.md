    <h3>Financial Statement Fraud Detection</h3>
    <p><strong>Competition:</strong> Fraud Detection in Financial Reporting (Kaggle)</p>
    <p><strong>Ranking:</strong> Top 15% (out of [Number] participants/teams)</p>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> March 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To develop a robust machine learning model to identify potential fraudulent patterns in corporate financial statements, aiming for high precision and recall.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Engineered over [Number] novel features from financial ratios, textual data (e.g., from MD&A sections using NLP techniques if applicable), and transactional patterns.</li>
        <li>Experimented with various algorithms, ultimately employing an ensemble of Random Forests and Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) that effectively captured complex fraud indicators, overcoming challenges like [mention a challenge, e.g., highly imbalanced dataset].</li>
        <li>Achieved an AUC score of [e.g., 0.91] on the private leaderboard, demonstrating strong predictive power.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Learning/Contribution:</strong> My feature engineering approach focusing on [mention specific aspect] was a key contributor to the model's performance. Shared methodology and insights in a public Kaggle notebook [link to notebook if available].</li>

    <h3>Hotel Booking Demand Forecasting</h3>
    <p><strong>Competition:</strong> Tourism Industry Predictive Analytics (Kaggle)</p>
    <p><strong>Ranking:</strong> Top 25% (out of [Number] participants/teams)</p>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> January 2025</p>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To accurately predict hotel booking demand by leveraging historical data and external factors, enabling better resource allocation and dynamic pricing strategies.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Developed a time series forecasting model (e.g., Prophet/SARIMA with exogenous variables) integrating seasonal trends, holiday effects, weather data, and local event schedules. My approach involved [mention a specific technique, e.g., careful handling of multiple seasonality].</li>
        <li>Performed extensive feature engineering to capture lead time dynamics, length of stay preferences, and customer segment behaviors.</li>
        <li>Created interactive visualizations to demonstrate booking patterns and the impact of different features on demand.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Learning/Contribution:</strong> Successfully identified [mention a key driver] as a significant predictor of booking cancellations, providing actionable insights for the hypothetical hotel. My model achieved a [mention metric, e.g., MAE of X bookings] on the test set. [Link to notebook if available].</li>

    <h3>Exploratory Analysis: Nepal Economic Indicators</h3>
    <p><strong>Source:</strong> Public Economic Datasets (Self-driven Project)</p>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> November 2024</p>
    <p><strong>Objective:</strong> To conduct an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Nepal's economic trends (2015-2024), with a focus on the tourism and hospitality sectors, to uncover growth patterns and correlations.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Collected, cleaned, and integrated data from multiple public sources (e.g., [mention sources like World Bank, Nepal Rastra Bank, Dept. of Tourism]).</li>
        <li>Performed comprehensive EDA, identifying key trends in GDP, inflation, tourism arrivals, and sector-specific employment using [mention tools, e.g., Python (Pandas, Matplotlib) and Tableau Public].</li>
        <li>Developed interactive dashboards visualizing these indicators and their interrelationships, highlighting [mention a specific interesting finding or visualization].</li>
        <li><strong>Key Contribution:</strong> Published a public report/kernel [link to it if available] summarizing the findings and providing an accessible overview of Nepal's recent economic trajectory, particularly the tourism sector's resilience/challenges post-[mention event if relevant].</li>
